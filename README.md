G'day guys! ğŸ‘‹ My name's Jason, and I'm a senior software engineer currently working on backend ASP.NET APIs in legal tech, in Sydney, Australia.

I'm interested in most things .NET related, backend APIs, databases and scalable system design ğŸ‘€

I'm currently learning how to use Redis as a primary database, which is super-interesting since it's often typecast as just a cache ğŸŒ± Not so!

You can reach me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-sultana-48213a48/, and are more than welcome to check out my blog at https://jason.sultana.net.au/  ğŸ“«
